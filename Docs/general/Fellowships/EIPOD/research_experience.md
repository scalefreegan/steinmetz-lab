During my PhD I studied gene regulatory networks (GRNs) in microorganisms. The structure of these networks describes which gene products regulate the production of which other genes. It is thought that the activity of these GRNs is responsible for generating expression patterns that help microorganisms cope with environmental change, e.g. ensuring that functionally related genes are expressed together. I developed algorithms to infer GRNs directly from high-throughput gene expression data for two organisms (nearly 2,500 microarrays). My models suggested that GRN structure is highly environment-dependent. I was able to show how this environmental-dependence leads to extensive transcriptional heterogeneity across conditions. I reported that the patterns of which genes are co-expressed together across environments are flexible, i.e., a particular gene can be co-expressed independently with functionally different sets of genes depending on the environment. I demonstrated, for example, that nearly 1/4 of all E. coli operons have environment-dependent transcription isoforms, which contradicts a long-standing dogma that operons are transcribed together as a single transcriptional unit. This heterogeneity, it turns out, also has important phenotypic consequences. Genes that were co-discovered in modules we call condition-specific co-regulated modules (corems) often have very similar fitness consequences when they are deleted. After developing my models, I dedicated myself to building open-source software for researchers to construct and explore their own models. These efforts resulted in construction of a M. tuberculosis model 50X faster than the original models.

For my postdoc I have joined Lars Steinmetz's lab at EMBL to extend my interdisciplinary training by taking on a more complex model system (yeast) and learning how to measure cells at multiple molecular scales. The group is well known for its forward-looking approach to emerging technologies, pioneering a number of technologies widely used by geneticists.
