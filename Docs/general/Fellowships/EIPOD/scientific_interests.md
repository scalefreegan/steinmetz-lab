New technologies are providing increasingly detailed measurement of biological systems. It remains a challenge, however, to integrate across these data to construct comprehensive representations of biological systems. These challenges are magnified when one considers leveraging additional information, such as genetics, to understand the origins of molecular differences observed between individuals. By the end of my PhD it was clear to me that comprehensive understanding of a biological system requires integrating across multiple scales of biological complexity. There are many new and exciting ways to measure biological systems, particularly phenotypes, but there are relatively fewer methods that "put the pieces together". Integrating heterogeneous data types is a real challenge. Thus it is my long term scientific goal to develop approaches that combine longitudinal molecular measurements with prior knowledge (e.g. genotype). This a promising strategy to address an age-old question: how does genotype lead to phenotype? 

The project I describe in my application emerged from an interest in how emerging technologies are reshaping approaches to healthcare. I have been fascinated by a new approach to preventative medicine that attempts to quantify and maintain "wellness" by combining longitudinal profiling with genetics.  Here, I saw an opportunity to create a project that would have implications for data integration within the basic sciences as well as personalized medicine. I have therefore designed a project to study a phenotype related to wellness (aging) by combining genetics with longitudinal molecular profiling. My hope is that the project will contribute a data integration paradigm for holistic modeling approaches.

HFSP funding will allow me to take on an ambitious project towards this goal, as well as establish collaborations that will help carry this work on in the future.
