Two features of my education and scientific training are unusual.

First, I received two undergraduate degrees from the University of New Mexico: a Bachelor of Science in Biochemistry and separate Bachelor of Arts in Political Science. Looking back, it is clear that my motivation to pursue both of these seemingly distant fields came from a more general fascination with complex systems. Over time I have seen the two worlds come together several times, with tangible consequences. This dual-expertise led me to develop algorithms inspired by the analysis of social networks and encouraged me to pursue additional training at the Santa Fe Institute, where I met a collaborator who played a critical role in the most important paper from my PhD (Brooks et al. 2014).

The second unusual aspect of my training (related to the first) involves a major thought and skill transition that occurred immediately after my undergraduate studies. Because of my fascination with complex systems - and in particular systems biology - I decided to transition from experimental molecular and cellular biology to computational biology. This was a difficult transition. I spent a year in between my undergraduate and graduate degrees working as an independent researcher in a Computer Science group. The data analysis skills I learned during that period have continued to play a defining role in my research, now that I am able to perform both experimental and computational studies.
