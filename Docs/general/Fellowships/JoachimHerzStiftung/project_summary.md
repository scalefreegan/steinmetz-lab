A new paradigm for personalized medicine is emerging in the biomedical sciences: quantified wellness. Rather than focus on treatment of disease by dissecting mechanisms and etiologies, this approach aims to monitor and quantify patient "wellness" by longitudinal tracking with a variety of physiological and molecular data [1]. This exciting new approach to medicine, however, raises a number of basic questions related to data integration that have yet to be addressed, primarily because the enabling technologies are newly developed, incompletely understood, and poorly integrated.  My proposal aims to develop a basic science understanding of how multiple omic-scale molecular readouts of cellular physiology should be combined with genetic information to establish molecular "fingerprints" predictive of large-scale phenotypes, such as health, using yeast as a tractable model system. Specifically, I will study a multifaceted process in yeast that approximates wellness, aging. The project will be conducted within the context of a tightly controlled genetic and experimental system so that I can directly evaluate relationships predicted between genetics, longitudinal molecular fingerprints, the environment, and quantitative phenotypes using targeted genetic interventions. I will combine multiple high-throughput molecular technologies with computational and statistical methods to develop predictive models of cellular function.

The design of this project integrates experimental approaches from several disciplines with computation. I have an interdisciplinary background with expertise in both experimental and computational approaches.

Microfluidics will be used to measure multiple aging phenotypes in mother cells. High-throughput omic technologies will be applied to quantify the molecular composition of cells at several stages of the aging process. Statistical learning algorithms will be applied to these large, heterogeneous datasets to derive multiomic fingerprints predictive of aging state. Finally, targeted genetic approaches will be used confirm whether genetic variation predicted by the model have a quantitative effect on fingerprints or aging. Each of these methods will be performed in a genetically diverse yeast population of 140 haploid segregants in two growth conditions to characterize the environmental (in)dependence of the genetic markers and their resulting age-specific molecular fingerprints.

Risk management. This project leverages a variety of methods that are either well established or in development. To minimize the risk of such a large and interdisciplinary project, I will rely on an worldwide network of collaborators that has been established by my host supervisor. Within this network I will have support from leading experts for every component of this project.

Aging is a complex, poorly understood biological process that is influenced by both genetic and non-genetic factors. I expect to observe differences in aging not only between strains with different genetic backgrounds but also within isogenic strains at different stages of the aging process. By combining molecular fingerprints with genetics, I will be able to identify single and combinations of loci that predict or directly influence the aging process. The model will make predictions about the molecular scale at which particular genetic variations manifest, from immediate consequences on transcription to downstream effects on metabolism, and will distinguish genetic factors with environmental dependence. Deconstruction of this complex phenotype will help determine whether molecular profiles and genetics are sufficient to diagnose a complex biological process and provide proof-of-principle approaches for integrating large heterogeneous datasets with genetic information to drive longitudinal, data-driven evaluation of complex phenotypes, including health in humans.
