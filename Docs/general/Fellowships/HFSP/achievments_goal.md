Summarize your research experience so far and describe what you consider to be your most
important research findings. Include your motivation for the proposed research, your choice
of host laboratory, how you are increasing your breadth of expertise, how this fellowship will help
you achieve your goals and how it fits in with your career plans and long term scientific goals.

I previously studied how gene regulatory networks (GRNs) operate. More specifically, I developed machine learning algorithms to infer GRNs directly from high-throughput gene expression data for two organisms (nearly 2,500 microarrays). My genome-scale models were able to predict (accurately and quantitatively) mechanisms responsible for regulation of each gene in the genome. Through this project I gained expertise in computational approaches (ensemble learning and graph theory) and experimental methods related to transcription.

For my postdoc I have joined Lars Steinmetz's lab at EMBL to extend my interdisciplinary training by taking on a more complex model system (yeast) and learning how to measure cells at multiple molecular scales. The group is well known for its forward-looking approach to emerging technologies, pioneering a number of technologies widely used by geneticists.

By the end of my PhD it was clear to me that comprehensive understanding of a biological system requires integrating across multiple scales of biological complexity. There are many new and exciting ways to measure biological systems, particularly phenotypes, but there are relatively fewer methods that "put the pieces together". Integrating heterogeneous data types is a real challenge. Thus it is my long term scientific goal to develop approaches that combine longitudinal molecular measurements with prior knowledge (e.g. genotype). This a promising strategy to address an age-old question: how does genotype lead to phenotype? HFSP funding will allow me to take on an ambitious project towards this goal, as well as establish collaborations that will help carry this work on in the future.
