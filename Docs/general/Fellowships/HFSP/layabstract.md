Lay abstract of research plan
(maximum of 1,000 characters including spaces and punctuation)

Describe your proposed research project in language that is understood by scientists who are not experts in the field. The abstract should introduce the subject, your motivation for the study as well as the major aims of the proposed project.

Wellness is a new frontier in personalized medicine. Several start-ups promise to provide data-driven approaches to health management by combining DNA sequencing with longitudinal molecular profiling to detect anomalies before they manifest disease. From a technical point of view, however, combining genetic information with molecular profiles to predict phenotype remains a significant challenge. I will address these questions by quantifying the relationship between genetic, molecular, and environmental factors in a genetically tractable yeast population for a phenotype related to wellness, aging.
