Lay abstract of research plan
(maximum of 1,000 characters including spaces and punctuation)

Describe your proposed research project in language that is understood by scientists who are not experts in the field. The abstract should introduce the subject, your motivation for the study as well as the major aims of the proposed project.

Wellness is a new frontier in personalized medicine. Start-ups have recently emerged to quantify wellness and provide data-driven approaches to its management.  These projects combine DNA sequencing with longitudinal molecular profiling, as well as coaching to improve health and detect anomalies before they manifest disease. From a technical point of view, however, combining genetic information with molecular profiles to predict phenotype remains a significant challenge. Does integration across multiple scales of molecular information allow more sensitive detection of changes in health? Can many weakly predictive genetic markers be combined with real-time molecular profiling to identify personalized molecular intervention points? As an EIPOD fellow I will address these questions by quantifying the relationship between genetic, molecular, and environmental factors in a genetically tractable yeast population for a phenotype related to wellness, aging.
