## Multiomic fingerprints of wellness in a genetically tractable yeast population

#### subject

Wellness is a new frontier in personalized medicine. Several start-ups have emerged promising to quantify wellness and provide data-driven approaches to its management. These projects combine DNA sequencing with longitudinal molecular profiling, as well as coaching to improve health and detect anomalies before they manifest disease. From a technical point of view, however, combining genetic information with molecular profiles to predict phenotype remains a significant challenge. Does integration across multiple scales of molecular information allow more sensitive detection of changes in health? Can many weakly predictive genetic markers be combined with real-time molecular profiling to identify personalized molecular intervention points? 

As a HFSP fellow I will address these questions by quantifying the relationship between genetic, molecular, and environmental factors in a genetically tractable yeast population for a phenotype related to wellness, aging.
