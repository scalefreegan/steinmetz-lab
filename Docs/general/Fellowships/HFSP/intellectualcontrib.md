Intellectual contribution to the proposal and change in research direction
(maximum of 1,000 characters including spaces and punctuation)

Describe the novel, innovative nature of the proposed work, your intellectual contribution to the project design (was this originally your idea?), and describe how you will increase the breadth of your expertise (e.g., new techniques, change in study species/system, etc.) through the proposed work.

My HFSP research proposal is an original idea. It emerged from my interest in how new technologies are reshaping healthcare and biological research more broadly. I saw an opportunity here to better understand a fundamental biological process that I find particularly fascinating, aging, through the lens of multiple "omic" technologies and genetics.

The project aims to expand the scope of my research capabilities. In the past decade I have developed an interdisciplinary background, gaining both computational and experimental proficiencies. This project will challenge me to develop additional expertise in metabolomics, proteomics, and microfluidics. My end goal is to develop a multifaceted view of the cell that will enhance our understanding of how genotype leads phenotype. The project will contribute a data integration paradigm for holistic modeling approaches that leverage emerging technologies to understand biological systems at an unprecedented scale.
