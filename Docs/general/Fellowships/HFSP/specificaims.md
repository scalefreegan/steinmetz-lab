Specific aims of research
(maximum of 500 characters including spaces and punctuation)

Briefly describe the main aims of your research project, including the hypothesis(es) you intend to test. The information should be concise and provide the reviewers with the key features of the project without having to refer to the proposal text.

H1: Multiple unidentified genetic factors influence aging
- Establish microfluidic system to identify genetic factors related to aging
H2: Genetic factors affect processes at different molecular scales
- Combine multiple omic measurements to determine molecular fingerprints of genetic variation
H3: The environment modifies genetic effects and alters their molecular fingerprints
- Measure fingerprints in a different growth condition to determine variations that are environmentally (in)dependent
