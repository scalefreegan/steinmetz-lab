# Introduction

The primary goal of clustQTL is to detect patterns, rather than perform QTL detection for a single (or even multiple) QTL measurements. For instance, we would like to detemine whether produce differental patterns of transcriptional isoforms.

Here, I simulate these possibiilites to determine whether clustQTL is ca

```{r, include=FALSE}
data(cars)
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```
